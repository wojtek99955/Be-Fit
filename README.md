## About

BeFit is a fitness app that helps people stay in shape. It offers a bunch of fitness calculators including bmi, daily calorie intake and activity calculators. Users can track their calorie intake and amount of nutrients during the day. All the data is stored in a firebase database so that the user can see how their intake changes throughout the month in the statistics section. Users are able to change their name, email and password in the user settings section. The firebase storage allows users adding avatar image to their profile. In case of password loss users can reset their password via email received from the app.
